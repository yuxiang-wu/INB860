# README #

This README is for assignment of INB860 of QUT.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is an assignment from INB860, Computational Intelligence for Control and Embedded Systems
* Lecturer:  Frederic Maire
* Group member: Yuxiang Wu, Marios Stavrakas
* Last update: 1 Jun 2014

### How do I get started? ###

* You need a Lego Mindstorm NXT Kit to run the RobotC code
* You will need a white board and black tape.
* Each source file is self-contain. You don't need extra configuration once you download your firmware and the program into the robot.
* You need to run the programs in "Calibration Programs" directories before you run most of the other programs.
* You can find an assignment specification in root directory.
* The directories are organized in chronological order. Their filenames indicate their corresponding behavior
* Some of the behaviors, including A3, A4, A5, D2 and E3, involves Matlab simulation. You can find them in "Matlab" directories under corresponding week directory.
