### How do I get started with reading? ###
Here are some guidelines:
* You need a Lego Mindstorm NXT Kit to run the RobotC code
* You will need a white board and black tape.
* Each source file is self-contain. You don't need extra configuration once you download your firmware and the program into the robot.
* You need to run the programs in "Calibration Programs" directories before you run most of the other programs.
* You can find an assignment specification in root directory.
* The directories are organized in chronological order. Their filenames indicate their corresponding behavior
* Some of the behaviors, including A3, A4, A5, D2 and E3, involves Matlab simulation. You can find them in "Matlab" directories under corresponding week directory.
